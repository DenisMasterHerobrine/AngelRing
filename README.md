<div align="center"> <h1>  Angel Ring 2</h1> </div>
<div align="center"> Angel Ring is a mod which adds a new ring into Minecraft. This ring allows you to fly like in a creative mode. Inspired by Extra Utilities 2. </div>

# About
Ever wanted to fly without using commands in Survival Mode? Then this mod is for you. Craft an Angel Ring and fly as long as you have Experience (XP) or FE/RF or any source of magical energy to fly. However, you can fly as much as you want by changing XP cost to `0` in `angelring-server.toml`

# What's the difference with the 1.x and 2.x versions?
- The Classic Version (1.x) is a simple standalone mod which brings just one ring without any mod integrations and allows you to fly.
- The Reworked Version (2.x) is an advanced, rebalanced and rich-featured version of The Classic Version, featuring rebalanced recipes, lots of mods integrations such as Botania, Blood Magic, Thermal Series and many more mod integrations, upgrades for the ring and reworked textures. 

# Compatibility
 - Compatible with mostly every mod at the moment, however some mod interactions can cause weird bugs. Feel free to report them as of now.

# Ports?
- Fabric/Quilt: **Planned**, but there's no ETA at the moment of writing this.
- Forge:
- - `1.19+`: Stable, shouldn't cause any problems as of now.
- - `1.18.2`: Stable, shouldn't cause any problems as of now, future content updates will come up to 1.20.
- - `1.16.5`: Stable, shouldn't cause any problems, only bugfixes will be done.
- - `1.14.x`, `1.15.x`, `1.17.x`: Stable, no support will be given since these versions isn't supported by Forge. Should work without any problems.
- - `1.12.2`: Use Extra Utilities 2 or other alternatives for this version.

# To-Do List
- Add Botania Mana/Blood Magic's LP integrations to deal with balance aspects of the ring for 1.18+. 
- Implement more types of Angel Ring
