<div align="center"> <h1>  Angel Ring 2</h1> </div>
<div align="center"> Angel Ring is a mod which adds a new ring into Minecraft. This ring allows you to fly like in a creative mode. Inspired by Extra Utilities 2. </div>

# Information
Ever wanted to fly without using commands in Survival Mode? Then this mod is for you. Craft an Angel Ring and fly as long as you want.

# What's the difference with the 1.x and 2.x versions?
- The Classic Version (1.x) is a simple standalone mod which brings just one ring without any mod integrations and allows you to fly.
- The Reworked Version (2.x) is an advanced, rebalanced and rich-featured version of The Classic Version, featuring rebalanced recipes, lots of mods integrations such as Botania, Blood Magic, Thermal Series and many more mod integrations, upgrades for the ring and reworked textures. 

# Compatibility
 - Compatible with mostly every mod at the moment, however some mod interactions can cause weird bugs, while breaking flight at all.

# Ports?
- Fabric: **Planned**, but there's no ETA at the moment of writing this.
- Forge:
- - 1.18+: Stable, shouldn't cause any problems as of now, however equip sound is still not fixed.
- - 1.16.x: Stable, however some custom **very big** modpacks have some issues with flying sometimes.
- - 1.14.x, 1.15.x, 1.17.x: Stable, no support will be given since these versions isn't supported by Forge. Should work without any problems.
- - 1.12.2: Use Extra Utilities 2 or other alternatives for this version.

# To-Do List
- Fix 1.16.x mod conflicts related to incompatible flight systems?
- Add XP, RF and Botania Mana integrations to deal with balance of the ring for 1.16/1.17. (However flight without any restriction will be still available, however will have much harder recipe?)
- Fix 1.17.x missing equip sounds.

NOTE: 
 - "master" branch is for builds supporting latest version.
 - "rewrite-1.17.1" branch is for 1.17.1 builds with rewriting some parts of the mod.
 - "1.16.1" and "1.16.5" branches are for 1.16.x builds. May be a bit different with 1.17.x versions due to several strange behaviours of other mods.
 - "1.15.2" branch is for 1.15.2 builds. (1.0.x)
 - "rewrite_1.14.4" branch is for 1.14.4 builds after moving to Curios API.
 - "old_1.14.4" branch is for 1.14.4 builds before moving to Curios API and requires a ring being in the inventory.
