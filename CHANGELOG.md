# Changelog - Angel Ring 2

## [2.3.0] - 2024-10-??

### Added
- Now Experience API supports Long values.

### Changed
- Changed the recipe for the Thermal Foundation's Angel Ring to use energetic one instead of the original one.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where the Angel Ring would not work properly when the player had more than ~15601 levels.
- Fixed an issue when the Angel Ring warned player about low energy, but the ring was in Classic Mode.

There may still be some incompatibilities with other mods, but we are working on it.
